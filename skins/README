This is the skins folder.
For each skin there should be a separate folder named after the skin.

Inside each skin folder are the img and css folders for the skin, e.g.

skins/
skins/academic/
skins/academic/css/
skins/academic/css/academic-nodes.css
skins/academic/css/academic-edges.css

skins/academic/img/
